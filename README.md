Projective Geometric Algebra 

Directions to start simulations:
1. Download Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
2. In Visual Studio Code go to Extensions and download 'Live Server'
3. Clone git repo and open folder in Visual Studio Code
4. Rightclick on html file you want to run and select 'Open with Live Server'
5. Have fun!!!

Different Simulations:
Reflections: lets you select one object to be reflected and one object to reflect. 
Projections: lets you choose a structure, perspective and if it should move in time.
products: explores the different products in PGA. Experiment and try to predict if an outcome is possible with the inserted structures and what to expect.
excercise_1: Try to build you own structure
excercise_2: Experiment with projections and perspectives
